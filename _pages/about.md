Currently, I am a BrainsCAN Fellow at Western University supervised by Drs. J Bruce Morton and Lindsay Bodell. I obtained my PhD in 2017 in the School of Public Health and Health Systems at the University of Waterloo. My research examines the link between brain health and diet across the lifespan using a combination repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), neuroimaging (EEG, fNIRS, fMRI, MRI).
